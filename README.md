# Mouspike - Coming soon page
conceptual and techinacal prototype is a funtional sketch.

# Descriprion
This project is a conceptual and technical prototype for my Mouspike brand this web prototype represent an early functinal "sketch" created before building the official Shopify website.
The page is not the final or official website it was created as a first step to visually and technically explore how the brand should look, feel, and how communicate before launching the full platform.

The goal of this project was not just to sell products yet,  but it was to validate ideas and turn an abstract vision into something real and structured with the right vision.

# Purpose of this project 
this coming soon page was used to:
Validate the brand identity.

Explore page structure and layout.

Define the tone and the visual language.

Test visual hierarchy and message placement.

Create a clear direction before building the full shopify website version.

This project helped transform ideas into a clear base that could later be improved and rebuilt at a higher level.

# Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Visual Studio Code (VS code)
this project focuses mainly on front-end structure and design logic.

# Project structure 
[index.html] main page structure.

[style.css] layout and visual styling.

[script.js] small interactive behavior.

[assets/] images and media files.

# Current status 
This is a front-end only project, the email form does not store data yet, and its not backend connected at this stage, the focused is on design, structure, and clarity of the brand message.
(*The backend logic for email collection is planned and explained separately in another repository.*)

# What exists today
The public coming soon page which is currently active at shopify store (under development) that website has official custom domains, and brand identity already defined and registered.
This project works as a bridge between the idea phase and the full implementation phase.

# What come next
In future stages, this project will evolve into:
A future full rebuilt with a stronger technical foundation, deeper storytelling and brand lore, and added more interactive elements but the most important stage will be a future AI assitant concept to help users understand the brand universe, (concept idea only, not a technical promise at this stage).
